ToDo 1 - Input Filter
------------------------------------------------
target clean input format: "google.com"

possible unclean prefixes of inputs:
- http://
- https://
- www.
exclude following terms: "http", ":", "/", "https", "www."

Yes totally right: a Domain name, which contains the excluded terms will
also get filteret with this code. But the domain www.http.org isn't really
interesting for me, so it can be a bit dirty here.

possible unclean post-fixes of inputs:
- /
- :
exclude following terms: "/", ":"

It's crucial to manage the filters of the postfixes by checking if 
the main domain is already correctly recognised.
